# FileTransporter
Moves files from one folder to another in real time. This script can be used for bulk transfer and is really quick.

## How To Use 📲:
You can see it's application by cloning the repository and running it. I have included 4 photos in the original_destination folder and 1 photo in the final_destination folder. After the program runs the 4 photos from the original_destination folder will get transfered to the final_destination folder making a total of 5 photos in it.

📁Original_Destination folder  ➡️   📁Final_Destination folder

## Customizability 🧰:
You can set the time_gap variable to 0 and the program will run continuasly tranfering any new file added.

I have set the default value to 10 which means the original_destination folder will get scanned every 10 seconds and transfer any new files, this mode will be useful it you are running some RAM demanding applications.
